I enjoy difficult challenges, even if it takes me time to solve them, because I like finding and analyzing new approaches that are unknown to me for solve them. I like collectible card games, strategy games, rope jumping, and I am a fan of cannelloni (a typical Neapolitan dish). But most importantly, I really love listening to music.",
